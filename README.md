# Randomized-Counter
Objective Your objective for this project is to implement a randomized counter in Assembly. A 4-digit SSD should be connected that will display your ID (last 4 digits) when your code is not counting (idle state). When an external button is pressed, it will generate a 4-digit random number, and start counting down to 0. The generated random number should be between 1000 - 9999. When the counter reaches 0, the number 0000 should be displayed for a second, then the code should go back to idle state waiting for the next button press. Pressing the button while counting down should pause counting, and pressing again should resume counting.
